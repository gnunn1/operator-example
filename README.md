WIP demonstrating different ways to install operators using OLM + GitOps showing various approaches and best practices.

Current examples:

1. Deployment of operator with automatic approvals
2. Deployment of operator with manual approvals
3. Deploying operator + instance as separate apps with App-of-App
4. Deploying operator + instance as a single application
5. Deploying multiple operators into the same namespace
